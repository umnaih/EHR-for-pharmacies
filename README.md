# Pharmacy EHR System

This repository houses a simple Electronic Health Records (EHR) system for pharmacies. It was developed as a part of the SEN2104 Data Management Systems course in 2021, where I took the lead in the project. In this README.md file, I will provide an overview of the project, outline the responsibilities of each team member, and provide insight into the key project components and accomplishments.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to create an efficient Electronic Health Records (EHR) system using SQL for data management. The system was designed to help pharmacies manage patient and prescription information effectively.

## Member-Task Responsibilities

As the team leader, my responsibilities encompassed various aspects of the project, including:

**a. Briefly Explain the Topic and State Member-Task Responsibilities**
   - Provide an introductory overview of the project's objectives.
   - Define the roles and responsibilities of each team member.
   - Ensure that the project progresses according to plan and achieves its objectives.

**b. Design an E-R Diagram**
   - Develop an Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram for visualizing the data structure.
   - Identify entities, attributes, and relationships within the system.
   - Define primary keys and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.

**c. Draw a Database Schema Diagram According to Our E-R Design**
   - Translate the E-R diagram into a detailed database schema.
   - Define tables, columns, data types, and constraints.
   - Ensure that the database design aligns with the E-R model.

**d. Show That Every Relation Satisfies at Least Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**
   - Conduct an analysis of the database schema to verify BCNF compliance.
   - Normalize tables to eliminate redundancy and mitigate update anomalies.
   - Guarantee data integrity through appropriate normalization techniques.

**e. Write 4 Different SQL Queries (2 Joins and 2 Aggregate Operations)**
   - Create SQL queries for retrieving and manipulating data.
   - Implement 2 JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.
   - Implement 2 Aggregate Operations to perform calculations on data.

**f. Prepare Documentation for the Project**
   - Document the project's design, requirements, and implementation details.
   - Develop user guides and manuals to facilitate system usage.
   - Maintain project documentation for future reference.

## Project Mate Responsibilities

My project mate had the following responsibilities:

**a. Write Necessary CREATE TABLE Statements**
   - Define SQL statements to create the database tables.
   - Specify table names, columns, and data types.
   - Include primary key and foreign key constraints.

**b. Write 3 Different INSERT INTO Statements**
   - Create SQL statements for inserting sample data into the tables.
   - Populate the database with representative information.
   - Ensure data consistency and validity.

**c. Write 4 Different SQL Queries (2 Nested Queries and 2 Set Operations)**
   - Formulate SQL queries that involve subqueries (nested queries) to retrieve specific data.
   - Implement 2 Set Operations (e.g., UNION, INTERSECT) to combine or compare data sets.

In collaboration, we successfully developed a comprehensive and functional pharmacy EHR system that met the requirements of our SEN2104 Data Management Systems course in 2021.
